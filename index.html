          <h2>Government of Alberta</h2>
          <h3>Wildfire Lookout Observer</h3>
          <h4>April 2009 - September 2019</h4>
          <p>Working alone in a remote location for up to 198 days at a time requires good planning and the discipline to follow through with those plans. Weather, wildlife, and administrative changes can challenge Lookout Observers to adapt to unplanned events and conditions. The extreme isolation that comes from being in the woods for so long is only combated by committing oneself to personal development. It was at my first tower that I started learning to code in ActionScript 3.0, and it was at my fire tower where I studied to earn a 4.0 GPA at NAIT. My time in the forest has been a secret weapon that I have used to accomplish my goals during the most successful decade of my life.</p>
          <p>Certifications required for Wildfire Lookout Observers includes CPR Level C with AED, a Radio Operator’s License, Incident Command System 100, and successful completion of the Lookout Observer Course at the Hinton Training Centre. Lookout Observers are trained in mapping, wildfire detection, radio protocols, wildfire reporting, safety (including interpersonal conflict management), fall arrest systems, weather recording, and the proper use of bear spray.</p> <!-- Job 2-->

          <h3>Supplemental Learning Leader (Lead)</h3>
          <h4>September 2014 - April 2016</h4>
          <p>The Digital Media and IT program at NAIT has two first-year courses, Database Fundamentals and Programming Fundamentals, where almost half of the students either receive D’s, F’s, or withdraw from the course. The Supplemental Learning Leader program takes students with high grades and hires them to re-take those courses alongside other students with the intent of providing in-class support and extracurricular group study sessions. Leaders encouraged students to start small personal projects that they could make contributions to throughout the semester and provided fun examples of simple games like hangman and tic-tac-toe or even console apps that could generate practice quizzes based on user input and Bloom’s Taxonomy of Knowledge. This position required excellent communication skills as well as empathy for understanding the stresses that many students were facing. Training also included a course on Mental Health First Aid provided through NAIT’s Professional Development department. </p> <!-- Job 4-->

          <h2>Edmonton Digital Arts College</h2>
          <h3>Guest Instructor</h3>
          <h4>November 2009 - October 2010</h4>
          <p>Developed a five-day drawing course surveying the human anatomy. Delivered course to three groups of students using multi-media presentations and demonstrations. The goal of this course was “Accessibility”, allowing students who did not have experience with drawing to enjoy the class as much as intermediate and expert artists. </p>
          <p>I loved spending one-on-one time with the students and helping them apply the day’s lessons to their portfolio projects. I often found myself staying several hours after class to discuss design concepts and get to know my students. I enjoyed the public speaking and provided excellent criticism by only having one or two suggestions for improvement before pointing out any issues with their work. It is important to understand the feelings of others and be sensitive to their personal level of ability before offering criticism that may otherwise be overwhelming and unhelpful.</p>

        <h3>Digital Media Production, Diploma</h3>
        <p>As a student at Guru Digital Arts (now renamed Edmonton Digital Arts College) I worked hard to separate myself as a designer. While my peers focused on Photoshop skills, I doubled my efforts to learn Illustrator. At first I struggled to get my drawing skills to show through in my vector-based artwork but now I feel that I have the ability to make illustrations that feel natural but are easy to work with digitally. I enjoyed learning typography and print design concepts from Joanne Simmons, and especially loved learning about non-destructive workflows from Christopher Caldwell. In April of 2018 I took Adult Beginner Ballet Lessons with EDAC Director Owen Brierly, which I think is a testament to my mentor’s incredible passion and creativity.</p> <!-- School 4-->
